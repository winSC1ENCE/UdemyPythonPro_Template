# Parallel Code Execution in Python

Threading (Concurrently):

- A new thread is spawned within the existing process
- Starting a thread is faster than starting a process
- Memory is shared between all threads
- Mutexes often necessary to control access to shared data

Multiprocessing (Parallel):

- A new process is started independent from the first process
- Starting a process is slower than starting a thread
- Memory is not shared between processes
- Mutexes not necessary (unless threading in the new process)

Async:

- Refers to the occurence of events independent of the main program flow
- Waiting for an event from the outside of our program
